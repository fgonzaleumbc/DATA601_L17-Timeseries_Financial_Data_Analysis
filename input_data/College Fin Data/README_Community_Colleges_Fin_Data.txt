Problem Statement:

We want to calculate the following:
- For the last five years which institutions expenses is increasing the most.
- For the last five years within each institution which Object/Functions expenses is increasing the most. Note that there may be multiple ways to do this. One would be to create a new column with combined Institution/Object/Function and have the loop be calculated for the categories of this new column.

Solutions:
- Can we create a MS Excel PivotTable and explore these trends?
- How can we automate these calculations in Python?
